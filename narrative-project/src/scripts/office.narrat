  "As you approach the door to Amanda's office, you start getting even more nervous, but at the same time you feel very determined. You use the accreditation Jared gave you to open the door. It works. The door opens, you take a deep breath and enter."
  "The office is very spacious and looks luxurious, it has a large window offering a stunning view of the city. In the center of the room you see a futuristic machine, powered by a glowing crystal: the Portalite."
  "Suddenly, a strong hit makes the room shake, and a huge portal opens inside the machine. Through it you can see something that looks like another world. A panorama of colors and shapes that defy all the logic and are impossible to understand. The power emanating from the portal is overwhelming, it hits you like a train and you start crying."
  "You see a group of people in futuristic suits get out of the portal. You quickly hide under a large piece of furniture. The leader removes their helmet and you see their face. It's a woman in her 50's, with short brown hair and a nose ring. It must be Amanda."
  talk amanda idle "Report. What's the current status of the Tormento district?"
  talk major "The district is completely under our control. The Watchers have retreated. Our technology and forces are superior, their resistance is quickly decreasing."
  talk amanda idle "Excellent. Every victory brings us closer to our final goal."
  talk sergeant idle "After all these years..."
  talk commander idle "With the power of Portalite you are unstoppable, Amanda. The sovereignty of the world is within your reach."
  talk sergeant idle "Commander, we have detected a sudden increment in the resistance of the Watchers. They seem to be grouping up for a significant counterattack!"
  talk amanda angry "I expected this. The Watchers are very resilient, but it doesn't really matter. With every world we conquer, our force grows."
  talk amanda idle "Any advances on Portalite?"
  talk commander "The energy extraction and amplification process are working beyond our expectations. We have detected two new worlds."
  talk amanda scary "Great, send a squad to investigate those lands. Mid-range soldiers. Cannon fodder."
  talk commander "At your orders!"
  talk amanda evil "Seems like everything is going according to plan."
  talk amanda idle "Still... no loose ends should be left. Do you know anything about our fallen angel?"
  talk major "Not yet. But it is clear that Maxwell is still alive. The corpse they have analysed is not his. He staged his death."
  "You're starting to understand the level of threat that Amanda and her team pose."
  talk maxwell idle "Jess, can you hear me?"
  talk jessica idle "Yes, I'm right in front of Portalite."
  talk maxwell angry "I know, I can see you."
  talk jessica scary "What? How?"
  talk maxwell angry "I'm here too, outside. Listen, when you give me a signal, I'll break the window. You'll need to act fast, take Portalite and jump."
  talk jessica scary "Are you nuts?! I'm at a 5th floor!"
  talk maxwell idle "Calm down. Jared is down there with a vehicle to escape. He prepared a safety net for you to fall on."
  talk maxwell angry "I know it's dangerous, and I'm sorry I have to ask you to do it. But there's no other way, we can't miss this opportunity."
  "You know how important this mission is. Everything depends on you..."
  talk maxwell idle "When you give me the signal, I'll break the glass. Whenever you say."
  "Amanda places Portalite on a table, while she's talking to her agents."
  talk amanda angry "Make sure Portalite is protected. We can not have any errors."

  talk jessica scary "Jared! No, No! It can't be..."

  talk maxwell angry "Please, don't hurt her... You already killed my friend, leave Jess alone."
  talk amanda happy "I see...our brave hero arrives to save the day. Do you really think you can negotiate in this situation?"
  talk maxwell scream "Yes, I think so. Jess! You have all the control. They won't shoot you. They won't risk breaking the crystal."
  talk amanda evil "Did you say Jess? Oh, right, it's your famous Jessica. Now it all makes sense."
  "You look Amanda straight in the eyes."
  talk jessica scream "I'll break the crystal without a doubt."
  "The tension in the air is intensifies. You firmly hold Portalite, aware of the destructive power you're holding in your hands. Amanda watches the scene, calculating and cold, evaluating her options."
  "Maxwell is slowly approaching, the soldiers are aiming at him, but he keeps threatening to destroy Portalite."
  talk jessica scary "<i>*voice shaking*</i> Max, stop! You're risking too much."
  talk amanda scream "You have no idea what you're doing. This crystal is more than power. It's the future."
  talk maxwell scream "You can't control the future, Amanda."

  talk jessica scream "It's the right thing to do! I can't let this power be in the wrong hands. I'm sorry, Max, but it's the only way..."
  talk maxwell scream "Wait! There's another way, believe me!"
  talk amanda happy "Maxwell, this girl is suffering. Let's get this over with. Haven't you done enough to her already?"

  talk maxwell scary "Amanda... Stop."
  talk jessica angry "What's going on?"
  talk amanda happy "Listen, you don't have to do it. The truth is that you don't matter here. Your only mistake was making a deal with the devil."

  talk jessica angry "What do you mean?"
  talk amanda evil "Oh, you don't know anything..."
  talk maxwell sad "Don't listen to her, Jess."
  talk amanda evil "Where do you think the energy in our weapons comes from? Of the NCP's big technology?"
  talk amanda evil "We feed on the pain. Just like the Watchers. We use your resources."
  "Maxwell screams at Amanda hysterically."
  talk maxwell scream "Shut up! Shut your mouth!!"
  talk amanda idle "We discovered that pain is the best energy, that's how it is. We have to generate pain in people. For the future, for us. We torture humans... I won't deny it, we don't have a clear conscience."
  talk amanda idle "But hey... The brightest stars emerge in the deepest darkness."
  talk amanda evil "Isn't that right, little star?"
  "Amanda comes close to you, looking you straight in the eyes. It feels like she could see through your soul."
  "You are terrified... You don't understand anything of what is happening..."
  talk jessica sad "How do you know this?"
  talk amanda happy "Sweetheart, we owe all of this to our best soldier. <i>*She points at Maxwell*</i>"
  talk amanda scary "He is the person with the least scruples. He wanted to obtain the greatest human pain... to obtain the greatest power."
  talk amanda evil "And that's where you step in."
  talk jessica sad "Me? Why?"
  "Amanda comes even closer and looks at your star-shaped pendant, the one that Maxwell gifted you. Your most valuable possession."
  talk amanda happy "That's a pretty pendant. Do you know what it really is?"
  "You look at her in disbelief."
  talk amanda idle "It's a pain collector. A very practical model. It makes it easier for us to collect energy. It even enhances pain's effects."
  talk amanda idle "This pendant has been absorbing your pain, your suffering. In order to give power to Maxwell."
  "Amanda changes her tone, simulating false pity."
  talk amanda happy "I'm sorry it had to be you. A happy young girl, full of happiness. Full of dreams and positive thoughts."
  talk amanda evil "But that's why you were the perfect candidate. We had to break you. Your suffering was going to give us a lot of energy."
  "The pain of betrayal spreads like a poison through your body, darkening beautiful memories and staining every shared moment with lie."
  "Broken inside, you turn to Maxwell. Your eyes are filled with tears."
  talk jessica sad "Max... Did you fake your death to make me suffer?"
  talk maxwell sad "It was necessary, my little st..."
  talk jessica scream " <i>*voice breaks*</i>Shut up! Don't call me that!"
  talk maxwell sad "Jess, you don't know how sorry I am and how much I regret it..."
  talk jessica sad "What about everything we lived together? All that love and care? It was all a lie?!"
  talk maxwell sad "No, no! I've always loved you with all my heart! It was all real..."
  talk amanda happy "Now that I believe."
  talk jessica sad "What?.."
  talk amanda idle "Of course, to make you suffer he first had to make you the happiest person in the world."
  "Anger and pain tie up in a knot of feelings and suffocate you."
  talk jessica sad "<i>*tearing up*</i> How could I be so blind? How could I trust you?"
  talk maxwell idle "Jess, all of this, I did it for us. It was the only way. I needed to take Amanda down."
  talk maxwell sad "But everything will change. All our pain will be gone and we will be happy for the rest of our lives. There will be no more suffering."
  talk jessica sad "How can you think you'll be able to achieve something like this?!"
  talk amanda idle "By destroying the Watchers. That's what he wants to do. Kill every one of them. Destroy a whole civilization."
  talk maxwell scream "The Watchers are just monsters! They are the literal representation of human pain."
  talk amanda scream "But they have a life. There are children among them. What did they do? It's not their fault they're like this. Do they deserve to die? They're just surviving, it's the nature.The weak are meat, and the strong do eat..."
  talk maxwell scream "Destroying their world is the best option. This way there will be no more pain in ours!"
  talk amanda scary "No, the best option is to take control of them. That's what the NCP does, control the enemy worlds. We protect humanity."
  talk amanda happy "Jessica, you have to trust me. I know I seem like the enemy to you. But my intention is to change the world. With the power of the Watchers. With that power I will heal the pain of good people, I will impart pain to those who need it, to those who deserve it, I will forge strong souls. I will create a new world where balance reigns. And now you can help me.."
  "A lot of doubts are swarming in your brain. You no longer know what's right and what's wrong. Your head is spinning. Anxiety is taking control over you..."
  "Maxwell looks defeated, about to give up."
  talk maxwell sad "Jess, don't let everything I did to you be in vain. Help us both free ourselves from this suffering, please."
