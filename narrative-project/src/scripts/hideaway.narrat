  "You are so overwhelmed that the words get stuck in your throat, you can't say anything."
  talk maxwell idle "I had to stage my suicide. It was necessary‚Ä¶"
  "Despite the thunderstorm of emotions taking control over you, you try to calm down. You breathe in and start talking to Maxwell."
  talk jessica sad "Why, Max? Why did you have to stage your death? After what happened to my father... Do you have any idea what it feels like? I've been living in hell for the last months."
  talk maxwell idle "Jess‚Ä¶ it's okay. The pain you've been feeling is not your fault."
  "His reply makes you even more mad."
  talk jessica angry "How could it possibly be my fault?!"
  talk maxwell idle "Listen, it's not my fault either."
  "This reply and his fake compassion drive you nuts, you're trying very hard not to burst into anger."

  talk maxwell idle "The world is not how you think it is. All the pain we feel has a reason. We are constantly stalked by the Watchers."
  talk jessica angry "Who are the Watchers?"
  talk maxwell idle "Well... It's hard to explain. They are always there, watching us and tormenting us. They feed on our pain and suffering, and intensify it."
  talk jessica angry "I can't believe you're making shit up to use it as an excuse."
  talk maxwell scream "It's true! The pain works like a source of energy for them, and they are also the reason. We need to get rid of them. That's why I'm here."
  "You think of all the years your spent studying Psychology and human nature, trying to find a way to help people, to heal them..."
  talk jessica scream "Get rid of all the pain? But Max, that's what we've been doing, that's what I've been doing! Don't you remember?!"
  talk maxwell scream "You don't understand! We can't truly help anyone as long as they exist!"
  talk jessica sad "You're not sane, Max. What happened to you?"
  talk maxwell scream "Jessica, I'm not crazy!"
  "In an instant Maxwell quickly moves towards you. For a moment you freeze, thinking he will hit you. But then you feel his arms around you and realize he's not trying to hurt you."
  talk maxwell sad "I'm sorry, Jess, I'm so so sorry..."
  "Your arms rise to hug him back... Time freezes while you're hugging each other. But then Maxwell lets you go."
  talk maxwell sad "I want to make everything clear for you, my little star. Ask me anything."

      talk maxwell idle "They're not against us, they just want to live. But they feed on our suffering, it's their fuel."
      talk maxwell idle "Many of them managed to get to our world. You might've noticed that many people around are more bitter than normally."
      talk maxwell idle "The Watchers are already attacking."
    "Why are they called Watchers?":
      talk maxwell idle "That's how our ancestors called them. These creatures have always been around, watching us closely, but we could never see them."
      talk maxwell idle "That's why they're called Watchers."
      talk jessica sad "Nobody ever saw them?"
      talk maxwell idle "See the Watchers, that's something very few people could do. And the ones who managed to, paid an unimaginable price."
      talk maxwell idle "Only those who have experiences the darkest human emotions have been able to see them."
      talk maxwell angry "They say their gaze is so intense, so disturbing that it gets to the bottom of your soul and tears it apart."

  talk jessica sad "What kind of needs?"
  talk maxwell idle "I'm not sure, but it's something very dark and horrendous. If Amanda gains the power of the Watchers, she'll be able to control humans' pain."

  talk jessica sad "Is she threatening you?"
